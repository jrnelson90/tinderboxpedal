## Enivronment Setup Notes:
* So far only tested with the Positive Grid Spark 40 Amp
* Pi version has so far only tested to run on the latest Raspberry Pi OS 32-bit lite image on Pi Zero W and Pi 4B (https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md).
* **ESP32 Setup:** https://github.com/jrnelson90/tinderboxpedal/wiki/ESP32-Arduino-Core-Setup-for-TinderBox-ESP-v0.3.1
* **Raspberry Pi OS Lite Setup:** https://github.com/jrnelson90/tinderboxpedal/wiki/Raspberry-Pi-OS-Lite-Setup
* **Please check your specific ESP32 dev board pinouts if attempting to use this version.**

On client, edit `tinderbox.py` or `tinderbox.ino` to match your GPIO mapping or OLED screen type before running.
On demo server (to run on another Pi if you don't have a Spark yet), edit `demoLedServer.py` to match your LED GPIO mapping before running.

## Basic Schematics:

### ESP32 Schematic
**In this code pins 4, 5, 18, and 19 are used for button input. Your ESP32 dev board's GPIO layout may be different, so please double-check after wiring and before running!**
